## Intro

**Game design is not gamification.**

A [study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281453299_Undermining_Children's_Intrinsic_Interest_with_Extrinsic_Reward_A_Test_of_the_Overjustification_Hypothesis) by Stanford University (Lepper, Greene, & Nisbett, 1973) on 50 children found that the group that was given a reward for performing a task spent half as must time doing the task than the group that did not receive the reward. The reward have halved their motivation. The reason for this comes down to **intrinsic** and **extrinsic** motivation.

**Intrinsic** Motivation: Doing things because we find them inherently satisfying and interesting.

**Extrinsic** Motivation: Doing things to achieve rewards.

Rewards massively undermines our intrinsic motivation. It is also why gamification does not work. The reason it appears to work is because the underlying experience is already a game.


## 7 Principles of Game Design

### 1. Create Goals that are concrete, achievable, and rewarding

> The best games create strong emotions, as emotions are the foundations of our memories.

Add small things to your product to widen your emotional repotoire (e.g. Superhuman showing serene/peaceful/sentimental/inspirational images once you reached inbox zero.)

### 2. Design for nuanced emotions

Create interactions that minimize friction for the user, and reduce their frustration when using their product.

### 3. Create rapid and robust controls

> Are toys the same as games. We play with toys, but we play games. A ball is a toy, but baseball is a game. And as it turns out, the best games are made with toys. And then they're fun on multiple levels. The level the toy, and of the game itself.

For example, have interactions/features that indulges playful explorations, include playful surprises.

### 4. Make fun toys, and combine them into games

> Consider your product, is it fun, even without a goal. Does it indulge moments of playful explorations, and does it create moments of playful surprises. If so congratulations, because then you have a toy and you're on the way to build a great game.

#### Flow

##### Flow is

Flow is:

1. So intense and focused concentration on the present
2. So absorbing we don't worry about the past or think about the future
3. So demanding that we don't care about what others think about us
4. So easy that we know what to do next
5. So powerful that we lose track of time
6. So rewarding that our activity becomes intrinsically motivated 

##### Conditions for Flow

You must:

1. Know what to do next
2. Know how to do it
3. Be free from distraction
4. Get clear and immediate feedback
5. Feel balanced and skill

### 5. Make the Next Action Obvious

### 6. Give Clear Feedback Immediately

### 7. Balance high perceived skills with high perceived challenges.

May counter-intuitively means making your product harder to use.

## Summary

7 Principles of Game Design:

1. Create concrete, achievable, and rewarding goals
2. Design for nuanced emotions
3. Create rapid and robust controls
4. Make fun toys, and combine them into games
5. Make the next action obvious
6. Give clear and immediate feedback with no distraction
7. Balance high perceived skill with high perceived challenge

If you follow these, your users will be intrinsically motivated. They will use your product not because they have to, but because they find it inherently interesting and satisfying.
